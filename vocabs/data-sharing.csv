https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API, api, "An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.[1] A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API, Web API, "A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser. It is a web development concept, usually limited to a web application's client-side (including any web frameworks being used), and thus usually does not include web server or browser implementation details such as SAPIs or APIs unless publicly accessible by a remote web application."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_registry,Metadata Registry, "A metadata repository is the database where metadata is stored. The registry also adds relationships with related metadata types. A metadata engine collects, stores and analyzes information about data and metadata (data about data) in use within a domain"

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV, webdav,"WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which allows user agents to collaboratively author contents directly in an HTTP web server by providing facilities for concurrency control and namespace operations, thus allowing Web to be viewed as a writeable, collaborative medium and not just a read-only medium. WebDAV is defined in RFC 4918 by a working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary,Controlled Vocabulary, "Controlled vocabularies provide a way to organize knowledge for subsequent retrieval. They are used in subject indexing schemes, subject headings, thesauri,[1][2] taxonomies and other knowledge organization systems. Controlled vocabulary schemes mandate the use of predefined, authorised terms that have been preselected by the designers of the schemes, in contrast to natural language vocabularies, which have no such restriction."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model,Data model,"A data model is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. For instance a data model may specify that the data element representing a car be composed of a number of other elements which in turn represent the color and size of the car and define its owner."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph,Knowledge Grpah,"In knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge graph is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model or topology to integrate data. Knowledge graphs are often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events, situations or abstract concepts – while also encoding the semantics underlying the used terminology.[1]"

Codelists can be used by Dimensions, Concepts, and Metadata Attributes to define the allowable content for both data and metadata reporting. Each Codelist contains zero to many Codes, each Code much belong to a Codelist."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data,FAIR,"FAIR data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.[1][2] The acronym and principles were defined in a March 2016 paper in the journal Scientific Data by a consortium of scientists and organizations."
